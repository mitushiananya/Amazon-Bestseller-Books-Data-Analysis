# Amazon Bestseller Books Data Analysis

Read this before you start.

The input CSV file in this repo is actually the output of [Web Scraping using Python](https://github.com/mitushiananya/Web-Scraping-using-Python/blob/main/Web%20Scrape%20Jupyter%20Notebook/AmazonBooksWebScrape.ipynb). So you can either run [AmazonBooksWebScrape.ipynb](https://github.com/mitushiananya/Web-Scraping-using-Python/blob/main/Web%20Scrape%20Jupyter%20Notebook/AmazonBooksWebScrape.ipynb) and get the file yourself or you can just directly donwload the CSV file. I would recommend to run [AmazonBooksWebScrape.ipynb](https://github.com/mitushiananya/Web-Scraping-using-Python/blob/main/Web%20Scrape%20Jupyter%20Notebook/AmazonBooksWebScrape.ipynb) and see for yourself than simply downloading the CSV file because the data you would get would be latest. 

I have provided both the Jupyter Notebook and Python Script, you can access whichever is convenient. 

There is one output chart (the Bokeh Plot) which opens in your browser, the image of which I have uploaded. Don't download it, it is just for reference.
